# N + 1 Problem

## Simple example

Let's say there is a function where selects a entity from database by id.

```
const findOneById(id: number) => {
    const queryText = "SELECT * FROM cars WHERE id = $1";

    pool.query(queryText, [number])
        .then(result => {
            //logic
        })
        .catch(error => {
            //logic
        })
}
```

The above function is valid. But what if  we are trying to get all car with the function? If there is a million entities,  there is also a million queries

```
SELECT * FROM cars WHERE id = 1;
SELECT * FROM cars WHERE id = 1;
SELECT * FROM cars WHERE id = 1;
SELECT * FROM cars WHERE id = 1;
...
...
SELECT * FROM cars WHERE id = 1000000;
```

One of the way to resolve this issue is to load all data before iterating through

```
const findOneById(ids: number[]) => {
    const queryText = "SELECT * FROM cars WHERE id IN ($1)";

    pool.query(queryText, [number])
        .then(result => {
            //logic
        })
        .catch(error => {
            //logic
        })
}
```

## In case of JPA and Hibernate (but not limited to)

The N+1 query problem happens when the data access framework executed N additional SQL statements to fetch the same data that could have been retrieved when executing the primary SQL query.

This normally hanppens one to many, many to one or many to many relationship.

```
@Entity
@Table(name="course")
public class Course {

    @ManytoOne
    private List<Instructor> instructors;
}
```

By default Fetch type for OneToMany and ManyToMany is Lazy. But ManyToOne is Eaget fetch by default, which means that, when we are trying to load lots of courses all the instructors mapped to each courses are loaded even though we are not going to use them.


```java
session.beginTransaction();

Query<Course> query = session.createQuery("SELECT c FROM Course c", Course.class);

List<Course> courses = query.getResultList();

session.getTransaction().commit();
```

As you can see fro the above picture, we ran just one query but 2 queries were run since it needed to load instructor information.
